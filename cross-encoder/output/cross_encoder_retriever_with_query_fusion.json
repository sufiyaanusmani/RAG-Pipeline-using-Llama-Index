Thus God had interposed\na veil between the evil spirits and the child who was to grow up to exalt His\nHoly Name. Ali has been described as having been found like a priceless pearl\nin the shell of the Kaaba, or a sword in the sheath of Allah's House, or as a\nlamp found in Allah's abode shedding light all around.\n\nThe sanctified birth of Ali, as that of Prophet Muhammad, was foretold in the\nscriptures, when God said toAbraham, who asked for a blessing on Ishmael; \"And\nas for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold I have blessed him,and will make him\nfruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly, twelve princes shall he beget,\nand I will make him a great nation.\" (Genesis 17 : 20).\n\nThe felicitous Prophecy in Genesis 17:20 about the advent of a prophet is said\nto point to the appearance ofMuhammad and Mi. While the 'Twelve Princes' of\nthe Mosaic Scriptures are held to be none other than the twelveHoly Imams.\n\nHazrat Ali's birth inside the Kaaba is unique. This is the only known occasion\non which a child was born within the precincts of the holy place ever since\nits foundation thousands of years ago.\n\nWhen Ali was about five years of age, Muhammad took him away from his uncle\nAbu Talib to bring him up as his own child.",
