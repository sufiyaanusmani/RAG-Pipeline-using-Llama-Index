The 12th Holy Im\u0101m (as) does not need\ncorruption to reappear. He rather needs the support of the masses who overtly\nyearn for his reappearance so that equilibrium is created in the society. So\nlong as the masses yearn for his reappearance without being ready for it, it\nwould be futile for him to appear. We must remember that the 12th Im\u0101m\u2019s\nmission is to create a global Islamic government. For such a government to\ntake form, he needs our support [_liyaq\u016bma al-n\u0101su bi al-qist_ (so that the\npeople stand in justice)]. And support, we must understand, can be to forgo so\nmany of our worldly interests. It may seem to be a simple issue, but the\nreality of the matter is quite different.\n\nThe concept of awaiting for the 12th Im\u0101m should be understood in its correct\nmeaning. The secret to its understanding is to ask ourselves about the purpose\nbehind our intiz\u0101r.",

The signs before reappearance of al-Mahdi (PBUH)**  \n  \nA number of narrations in the Shi'ite collections of traditions inform us of\nsome signs that will take place before the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi\n(PBUH). Some of these signs describe the hard condition of people in the world\nbefore his reappearance. For instance, Abu Hamza al-Thumali and Abu Basir have\nboth narrated:  \n  \nImam Muhammad al-Baqir (PBUH) said, \"The Qa'im shall not rise until after a\ngreat fear from people, the earthquake, afflictions, trials, and the plague\nhave been inflicted upon people, the war between Arabs, great disagreement\namong people,  \n  \nbreakups in their religion, change in their situation so that the wishers wish\ndeath every morning and night due to the enormity of what is observed, and the\neating of people by people.  \n  \nThe emergence of al-Qa'im (PBUH) shall be at the time of despair and\nhopelessness of people for finding any (other) opening or relief.\"[1] On the\nother hand, some signs are about the miraculous events that will happen just\nprior to the reappearance of al-Qa'im (PBUH).  \n  \nFor instance, there will be a lunar eclipse at the end of the month of\nRamadhan. The eclipse at the end of the month is a supernatural phenomenon\nthat has never happened before. Badr Ibn Khalil al-Azdi narrated:  \n  \n[1]  \nal-Ghaiba, al-Nu'mani, p. 234, Hadith 22; p. 253, Hadith 13; Bihar al-Anwar,\nvol. 52, p. 348, Hadith 99; p.",

The Holy Quran\nrecords the concealment of various prophets (as) like Hazrat Ibrahim (as)\n(Sura Maryam: 48-49), Hazrat Musa (as) (Sura Qasas:21-22) and Hazrat Isa (as)\n(Sura Nisa: 157).The Holy Prophet (S.A.W.S.) and the Imams (asws) had pointed\nout to the people the imminent occultation of their last proof (Imam Mahdi\n(atfs)). So that no doubt or misunderstanding should remain, regarding this\nproblem. The occultation (Ghaibat) of the twelfth Imam consists ,of two\nphases. One is Ghaibat-e-Sughra (The lesser occultation) and the second is\nGhaibat-e-Kubra (The greater occultation). Imam Jaffar as Sadiq (asws) said:  \n  \n'_There are two occultations for Qaem. One is short and the other prolonged.\nIn the short occultation only the special shias will know of his whereabouts.\nAnd in the longer occultation only his trustworthy servants will know where he\nis\"_ (Al Kafi Vol. 1 Pg. 340. Ghaibat Nomani Pg. 180) According to the well-\nknown reports, the lesser occultation (ghaibat-e-sugra) commenced from the\nyear of his Imamat in 260 A.H and continued for 69 years.",

For this reason,\nat the beginning of his mission, many people will think he has brought a new\nreligion. Muhammad Ibn Ijlan narrated:  \n  \nImam al-Sadiq (PBUH) said, \"When our Qa'im rises he shall call people anew to\nIslam and shall guide them to the things that were eliminated and from which\npeople had turned away.  \n  \nHe is called Mahdi because he will guide people to the thing from which they\nhave been separated. He is called al-Qa'im because of his rise for\n(establishing) the truth.\"[2] Thus, the opposition to Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH)\nwill not be due to people's failure in identifying him, but rather due to\ntheir disbelief in the original laws of [1]al-Ghaiba, al-Nu'mani, p. 296,\nHadith 1.  \n[2]al-Irshad, vol. 2, p. 383; Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 51, p. 30, Hadith 7.  \n  \n  \nthe religion, their overlooking of the transmitted traditions, and their\nfollowing man-made ideas and opinions in the domain of religion.\n\n\n## Chapter 9 7 \\- Is lack of the occurrence of signs a reason for the delay in\nrelief?\n\nThe manifestation of the signs depends on when Allah decides to make the Imam\n(PBUH) reappear.",
