The signs before reappearance of al-Mahdi (PBUH)**  \n  \nA number of narrations in the Shi'ite collections of traditions inform us of\nsome signs that will take place before the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi\n(PBUH). Some of these signs describe the hard condition of people in the world\nbefore his reappearance. For instance, Abu Hamza al-Thumali and Abu Basir have\nboth narrated:  \n  \nImam Muhammad al-Baqir (PBUH) said, \"The Qa'im shall not rise until after a\ngreat fear from people, the earthquake, afflictions, trials, and the plague\nhave been inflicted upon people, the war between Arabs, great disagreement\namong people,  \n  \nbreakups in their religion, change in their situation so that the wishers wish\ndeath every morning and night due to the enormity of what is observed, and the\neating of people by people.  \n  \nThe emergence of al-Qa'im (PBUH) shall be at the time of despair and\nhopelessness of people for finding any (other) opening or relief.\"[1] On the\nother hand, some signs are about the miraculous events that will happen just\nprior to the reappearance of al-Qa'im (PBUH).  \n  \nFor instance, there will be a lunar eclipse at the end of the month of\nRamadhan. The eclipse at the end of the month is a supernatural phenomenon\nthat has never happened before. Badr Ibn Khalil al-Azdi narrated:  \n  \n[1]  \nal-Ghaiba, al-Nu'mani, p. 234, Hadith 22; p. 253, Hadith 13; Bihar al-Anwar,\nvol. 52, p. 348, Hadith 99; p.",
