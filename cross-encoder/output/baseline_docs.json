He is the last of\nthe true Caliphs of The Prophet; and the last of the Twelve Imams of the\nMuslims. He is alive in the world and has been granted long life by God. He is\nin concealment (cannot be seen). He will appear before the Day of Judgement\nwhen the world will be full of injustice and sins. He will fill the world with\njustice, equity and equality.\n\nThe Prophet (S.A.W.) and the Imams (A.S.) have predicted that he would live\nand not die.\n\nHe will rule over the world and will establish justice and wipe off the\noppressors. As God has declared: \"May God make (it) triumphant over all other\nreligions even though the idolators might be angered.\"\n\nO God! Make imminent his appearance and make us amongst his helpers and\ncompanions.\n\nSince the Imam went into concealment in his house, the Muslims go to the place\nat Samarra to worship God. This place is known as \u201cSardab-ul-Ghaibat.\u201d",

Henceforth, no one mil see me, unless and until Allah makes me appear. My reappearance will take place after a very long time, when the world will be full of injustice and violence\"_. (Kamaaluddin Vol.2 Pg.516 Ghaibate Tusi Pg.395) Ultimately, the shining sun of the divine proof went behind the curtain of Ghaibat, completely. And the period of communication with Imam Mahdi (atfs) (through Nawab-e-Arba) came to an end. Inspite of this (his Ghaibat) Imam Mahdi (atfs) is the Imam of the time and Imam of the world. He is the Divine Proof. Even though his person may be hidden from our eyes but his commands are clear. Amirul Momineen Ali (asws) announced from his pulpit at Kufa: _\"Even if the person of the Divine Proof is hidden while he guides the people, his knowledge and manners will be clear for them to follow\"_ (Kamaaluddin vol. I Pg.302) It is clear that the knowledge and practice of Imam Asr (atfs) is impeccable like the Quran. As was the sunnat of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.S.).",

Thus, such warnings are, by themselves,\nconstructive if people react to them by turning to Allah before the actual\nmanifestation of the signs.  \n  \nOn the other hand, if a sign does finally occur, it strengthens one's faith in\nthe reappearance of Imam (PBUH) and increases his anticipation. Once a sign\noccurs, a believer realizes that it was among the signs foretold, and thus,\nhis faith and confidence will increase, and he trusts that the time of\nreappearance is closer than ever.  \n  \nThus, the foretold events should not be ignored or considered as insignificant\nbefore and after their occurrence.  \n  \nNevertheless, the signs were not given for the purpose of predicting the time\nof reappearance or for urging people to search the scientific data to estimate\nthe time of the occurrence of the sign itself. Rather, they serve as reminders\nfor people only after they occur miraculously. The signs were described in\norder to keep us alert, aware, and mindful of Allah, but not to enable us to\nmake any kind of prediction.  \n  \nKeeping in mind the issue of al-Badaa, all the mentioned signs before his\narrival, even if they finally occur, they may happen miraculously in an\nunpredictable manner.  \n  \nAs we have seen in a tradition quoted earlier, some of the signs such as an\neclipse of the moon at the end of the month can only happen miraculously.",
