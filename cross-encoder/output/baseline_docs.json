We were astonished as to how\nAli could know this and how he could count them.\"\n\nThe Holy Prophet smiled and asked Ali how he could know that so many angels\nhad come to him. The Holy Imam said: \"May my father and mother sacrifice their\nlives for you! Each of the angels who came to you and saluted you spoke in a\ndifferent language. On calculation, I found that they had spoken in 120,000\nlanguages, so I knew that 120,000 angels had come to you.\"\n\nThe Holy Prophet said: \"O, Abu'l-Hasan! May Allah increase your knowledge and\nmodesty.\" Then turning to the people the Holy Prophet said: \"I am the city of\nknowledge, and Ali is its gate. There is no greater event and no greater sign\nthan he is. He is the Imam of the people, the best of mankind, trustee of\nAllah and repository of His knowledge. He is the 'people of Dhikr', among\nthose referred to by the words of Allah: 'So ask you the people of Dhikr if\nyou know not.'(16:43) I am the treasury of knowledge and Ali is its key. So\nwhoever wishes to obtain the treasure must come to the key.\"\n\nIf you can point to a single companion or relation of the Holy Prophet who\ncould rival Ali's merits, I would certainly bow my head before him. But if you\ncannot, then it would be your religious duty to attach yourselves to the truth\nwithout caring what the world might think.
