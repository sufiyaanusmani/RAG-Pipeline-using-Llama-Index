      "The Resolution Of Spurious Doubts Concerning Determinism\n",
      "\n",
      "The most substantial arguments of fatalism are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1\\. The will of man takes it form due to the stimulation of intrinsic and\n",
      "internal tendencies. The existence of these tendencies is neither in control\n",
      "of man nor the stimulation of it through external means. Thus, there is no\n",
      "room for human volition and determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer to this is that the agitation of internal tendencies creates the\n",
      "grounds for the will and decision-making, but does not make the decision to\n",
      "carry out the action. The only way that it will be considered as a compulsion\n",
      "is when there is derivational steadfastness. The proof for this is that when\n",
      "we are in the process of decision-making, we calculate the pros and cons of\n",
      "the decision or we hesitate in making a decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "2\\. On the basis of the various sciences, it has been proven that tendencies\n",
      "are hereditary and also that the environmental and social surroundings\n",
      "determine their configuration. The difference in the mannerisms and behavior\n",
      "of man is due to the very fact that there is diversity in the human social and\n",
      "environmental surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "This very reality more or less is also accepted in the religious documents,\n",
      "thus on these bases one cannot accept that the actions of man emanates from\n",
      "freewill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer to this argument raised is that the acceptance of freewill and will\n",
      "does not mean the denial of these aspects of tendencies, but it means that\n",
      "humans even after being effected by these environmental, social, and\n",
      "hereditary conditions can still resist and decide at the time of the arousal\n",
      "of inclinations. It is certain that the requirement of the struggle against\n",

      "3 Another one of the spurious doubts of the determinist is that God the\n",
      "Supreme has knowledge of the entire phenomena and actions of man before they\n",
      "act upon it, and that the knowledge of God is impeccable. Therefore, all of\n",
      "the actions have to take place according to the eternal knowledge of God, and\n",

      "\n",
      "The answer to this doubt would be that the knowledge of God is implicated with\n",
      "every action that takes place and the attribute of man being free in his\n",
      "decision-making or having the freewill is also known by God. Hence if\n",

      "be ‘granting rights to one who deserves.’ Therefore, initially one must\n",

      "right will be known as justice, and the violation of it will be regarded as\n",
      "tyranny. However, occasionally the concept of justice can be extended and\n",
      "regarded in the meaning of ‘the performance of work befittingly or as to place\n",
      "all things in its proper place.’ According to the latter definition, justice\n",
      "is tantamount to wisdom and just work is wise work. Nevertheless, the\n",
      "determination of the ‘right of the deserved-one’ and what a ‘proper place’ is,\n",
      "involves a vast domain of words, which is usually discussed in the philosophy\n",

      "bread from an orphan’s hand without any reason or kills an innocent person for\n",
      "no reason, they have persecuted and oppressed, and therefore committed an evil\n",

      "The first intellectual reason for the necessity of the prophets’ immunity\n",
      "against committing sin, is that the main objective for their mission is to\n",
      "guide man towards the truth and teach him how to perform the duties God has\n",
      "assigned to him. Moreover, the prophets are in fact the representatives of God\n",
      "among men and must guide them towards the right path _(al-sirat al-mustaqim)_.\n",
      "However, if such representatives and missionaries do not obey the Divine\n",
      "instructions themselves and their behavior contradicts their mission, people\n",
      "will find the contrast between their words and behavior contradictory and,\n",
      "therefore, the objective of their mission will not be thoroughly fulfilled.\n",
      "Thus, God’s wisdom and kindness necessitates that the prophets be pure and\n",
      "innocent, and for them to refrain from committing any undeserving action even\n",
      "if unintentional or due to forgetfulness. The people will thus never accept\n",
      "unwillingness or forgetfulness as an excuse for the prophets to commit a sin.\n",

      "The second intellectual reason for such infallibility is that, rather than\n",

      "The response to the above doubt has been given in my previous discussions;\n",

      "that they have no choice over the optional aspects of their lives. As\n",
      "discussed in previous lessons, although God’s will dominate the occurrence of\n",
      "all events, it does not intervene or repel man’s will, but rather parallels\n",
      "it. However, when God’s attention towards man accommodates a specific\n",

      "\n",
      "A) God’s prophets have confirmed each other and each one predicted his\n",
      "successor[17](epub.html#f_a47ec4e3_17). Therefore, if a person claimed to be a\n",
      "Prophet and denied his preceding or succeeding prophets, he would be a liar.\n",
      "\n",
      "B) God’s prophets did not request any payment or reward for performing their\n",
      "duties[18](epub.html#f_e1ed6936_18); only the Prophet of Islam (S) has\n",
      "recommended his nation to be friends with the knowledgeable\n",
      "people[19](epub.html#f_3e5bcbcd_19) and has considered it as the reward for\n",
      "his endeavor. In this way, he urged his nation to obey the (instructions given\n",
      "by the Islamic) scholars. The benefits of such obedience will in fact return\n",
      "to the nation themselves[20](epub.html#f_cff1fc3c_20).\n",
      "\n",
      "C) Some prophets have had other exalted positions such as ‘Judge’ and\n",
      "‘Governor’ (David and Solomon). In addition, verse al-Nisa’:64 have\n",
      "necessitated the unconditional obedience of every Prophet. Therefore, it can\n",
      "be inferred that all the prophets (‘a) have had the same Divine positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "D) The Jinn, who have the freedom of decision-making and are responsible for\n",
      "their deeds, and in normal conditions are invisible, were aware of the\n",
      "invitations made by some of God’s prophets. The pious Jinn believed in them,\n",

      "\n",
      "Among them were Noah (‘a), Abraham (‘a), Moses (‘a), and Jesus (‘a), who all\n",

      "Any individual with an open mind who looks into the testaments would surely\n",
      "realize that none of them are the books that were revealed to Moses or Jesus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the Torah apart from characterizing God as a man has also regarded\n",
      "Him as regretting many of His actions. God is described as wrestling with one\n",
      "of his servants (Jacob) and could not defeat him, eventually imploring him to\n",

      "Intellectual Reasoning Upon The Immateriality Of The Soul\n",
      "\n",
      "For centuries, philosophers and intellectuals have discussed the subject of\n",
      "the soul (known in philosophical terminology the _nafs_). Islamic philosophers\n",
      "in particular have given this topic special attention, and as opposed to\n",
      "devoting just a chapter in their books to it, have in turn written independent\n",
      "books. They have rejected the concept of the soul being an outward form of the\n",
      "body, or a form of matter, on several intellectual reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is apparent that this is indeed a vast subject and beyond the scope of this\n",
      "book to cover, we will therefore suffice ourselves with a small discussion and\n",
      "give a clear explanation, which will satisfy the establishment of our thought.\n",
      "This explanation is based upon a few intellectual arguments and a premise,\n",
      "which begins as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "We observe the color of our skin and the structure of our body with our own\n",
      "eyes; we feel its softness and firmness with our sense perception and\n",
      "understand the inner configuration indirectly. However, our fear, anger, will,\n",
      "thought, and emotions can also be sensed without the means of senses and we\n",
      "are also aware of different psychological states and realize the ‘I’ ness,\n",
      "which is enclosed with likes and dislikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, universally man is bestowed with two types of perception, the first can\n",
      "be considered as those perceptions that can be perceived or sensed through the\n",
      "senses and the second type of perceptions are those that do not require the\n",
      "sensual organs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point to be noted is that the first form of perception which is\n",
      "derived from the senses has the possibility of fault and this is contrary to\n",
      "the second type of perception where there is no intrusion of fault. For\n",
      "example, it is possible that someone might doubt that the color of the skin he\n",

      "likewise the existence of fear, emotions and mercy, or thought and will are\n",
      "also certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question arises as to whether this ‘I’ is the same as the material body,\n",
      "or whether it is a psychological state extended from the body, or whether its\n",
