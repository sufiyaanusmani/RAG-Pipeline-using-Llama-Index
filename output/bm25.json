When\ndid he die and where?_\n\n**A:** Salman (r.a.) was appointed governor of Mada'in by the 2nd caliph. The\ncaliph usually changed governors every two years. When he got the news that\nSalman (r.a.) was about to enter Medina, the caliph went out with many\ncompanions to welcome him. It was a very unusual honour paid to returning\ngovernor. The reason became clear when they saw Salman (r.a.) returning with\nthe same robe in which he had set out. He had not taken from the treasury\nanything for himself during his governorate.\n\nThen Salman (r.a.) settled in Basrah, where he married a lady. After a few\nyears, he shifted with his family to Mada'in. I think he did so because\nMada'in people spoke Persian.\n\nHe died in Mada'in in the last year of 'Uthman's caliphate, i.e. in 36 A.H.\n(Vide At-Tabaqat by Ibn Sa'd, vol.4, p.93).",
