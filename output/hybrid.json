When he got the news that\nSalman (r.a.) was about to enter Medina, the caliph went out with many\ncompanions to welcome him. It was a very unusual honour paid to returning\ngovernor. The reason became clear when they saw Salman (r.a.) returning with\nthe same robe in which he had set out. He had not taken from the treasury\nanything for himself during his governorate.\n\nThen Salman (r.a.) settled in Basrah, where he married a lady. After a few\nyears, he shifted with his family to Mada'in. I think he did so because\nMada'in people spoke Persian.\n\nHe died in Mada'in in the last year of 'Uthman's caliphate, i.e. in 36 A.H.\n(Vide At-Tabaqat by Ibn Sa'd, vol.4, p.93).",

The Commander of the\nFaithful says about the forefathers of the Holy Prophet: \"Allah provided for\nthem (i.e., the Prophets) the best place (the loins of their forefathers) and\ngave them the best placements (the holy wombs of their mothers). He\ntransferred them from distinguished and respectable loins to pure wombs. When\nthe father of any of them passed away, his son succeeded him with the religion\nof Allah, until Allah Almighty made Muhammad His Prophet and Messenger. So He\nmade the source of the Holy Prophet's creation the most exalted one. The Holy\nProphet's lineage included His Prophets who were of high rank.\"\n\nIn short, the ancestors of the Holy Prophet, back to the Prophet Adam, were\nall believers and monotheists. It is quite obvious that the people of the Ahle\nBait (the Progeny) of the Holy Prophet knew more about the status of their\nforefathers than others knew.\n\n\n### ALI'S FOREFATHERS WERE EQUALLY FREE FROM POLYTHEISM\n\nWhen it is proved that the ancestors of the Holy Prophet were believers and\nmonotheists, it naturally follows that Ali's ancestors were also worshipers of\nAllah. I have already proved through your own books that Muhammad and Ali were\nfrom one light and always remained together in pure loins and wombs until they\nwere separated from each other in the loins of Abdu'l-Muttalib. Every sensible\nman would admit that such a distinguished personality was the rightful\nclaimant to the caliphate.",
