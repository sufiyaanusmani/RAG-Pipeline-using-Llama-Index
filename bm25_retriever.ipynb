This reading is attributed to a group of commentators, and it does not suffer from any fundamental flaws, except that it does not accord with the context of the verse. This is because God denies Noah’s son belonging with him in the same sense as Noah affirms it. Noah did not mean by his belonging that he was a believer and not a disbeliever, but rather that he belonged to him in the sense of being both one of his nearest and dearest and being righteousness, even if faith was a prerequisite of this. Therefore, this ultimately refers back to the reading we have presented above.\r\n",

Thus, Noah said, *‘My son is indeed from my family’* based on outward appearances, and God informed him that the matter was contrary to this, alerting him to his wife’s infidelity. This explanation is attributed to al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and Mujāhid.\r\n",

       "The problem with this explanation is, first of all, the fact that it associates shame and disgrace with one of God’s prophets and the general sense of the Qurʾān precludes such a possibility. In the Qurʾān, God repels such dishonor from the vicinity of the prophets and exonerates them from association with such falsehoods. More than this however, this explanation suffers from the fact that there is no evidence for it in the language used in the verse. There is nothing in the story other than God’s statement: *O Noah! Indeed He is not of your family. Indeed he is unrighteous conduct,* which does not provide any clear support for such conjectures.<br>"

Therefore, this ultimately refers back to the reading we have presented above.\r\n",

       "Another explanation is that he was not his son in reality, but only born in his house. Thus, Noah said, *‘My son is indeed from my family’* based on outward appearances, and God informed him that the matter was contrary to this, alerting him to his wife’s infidelity. This explanation is attributed to al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and Mujāhid.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "The problem with this explanation is, first of all, the fact that it associates shame and disgrace with one of God’s prophets and the general sense of the Qurʾān precludes such a possibility. In the Qurʾān, God repels such dishonor from the vicinity of the prophets and exonerates them from association with such falsehoods. More than this however, this explanation suffers from the fact that there is no evidence for it in the language used in the verse. There is nothing in the story other than God’s statement: *O Noah! Indeed He is not of your family. Indeed he is unrighteous conduct,* which does not provide any clear support for such conjectures.<br>"

For it was Noah who had explicitly called for the disbelievers to be purged from the earth when he said: *‘My Lord! Do not leave on the earth any inhabitant from among the faithless!’* The fact that he said this while calling his son to board the Ark shows that Noah considered this son to be a believer. His disobedience to his father’s command to board the Ark was not itself an act of disbelief (*kufr*) nor tantamount to it, but was merely a sin (*ma‘ṣiya*), which falls short of total disbelief.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "It was in light of this that Noah said, *‘My Lord! My son is indeed from my family. Your promise is indeed true* (wa inna wa‘daka al-ḥaqq) ...’—he recalled the promise of his Lord to deliver his family and added that his son was part of his family. The fact that he invokes God as *‘Lord’ (rabb)* indicates that this is an appeal for divine mercy; the fact that he uses the possessive pronoun *‘my’* in *‘my son’* and *‘my family’* is to demonstrate his argument; while the use of the preposition *inna* (‘indeed’) and the definite article *(al-)* in *Your promise is indeed true* show that his faith in God is genuine.\r\n",
       "\r\n",
       "Now, placing the two statements, *‘My son is indeed from my family’* and *‘indeed, Your promise is true’*, side-by-side, imply that his son should have survived the flood. However, note that Noah, as a divine servant, shows humility towards God by not explicitly drawing this conclusion. Indeed, judgement belongs only to God.<br>"
