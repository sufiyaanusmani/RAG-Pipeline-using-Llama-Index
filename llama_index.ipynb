      "The word monotheism from the lexical point of view means ‘oneness or unity’,\n",
      "but in philosophy, scholastic theology, ethics _(akhlaq),_ and mysticism it\n",
      "has been applied with various different meanings. However it gives the same\n",
      "basic meaning in all of these sciences, but when viewed from different aspects\n",
      "it can be regarded differently, such as ‘the different forms of oneness’ or\n",
      "‘the different levels of oneness’. The investigation of these offshoots cannot\n",
      "be comprised in these writings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, from this angle it is sufficient enough that we bring the most\n",

      "\n",
      "## The Negation Of Plurality\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial and distinguished meaning of monotheism is that very believing in\n",
      "the unity of God and negation of plurality and multiplicity outside its\n",
      "essence. This belief is in complete opposition to polytheism, and the belief\n",
      "in two or more gods who are independent and apart in their existence from each\n",

      "## The Negation Of Composition\n",

      "This meaning is usually interpreted as the negative attributes _(al-sifat al-\n",

Contradictions in multiple gods:\\n- If each phenomenon is created by a specific god, it implies that each phenomenon depends solely on its creator.\\n- This would lead to a complex and deteriorating order in the universe, contrary to the observed unity and interconnectedness of all phenomena.\\n- The interdependence of phenomena and the continuity of cause and effect relationships suggest a single unified source of creation.\\n\\n### 3. Unity and order in the universe:\\n- The text emphasizes that the universe exhibits a singular order where all phenomena are interconnected and mutually dependent.\\n- The link between past, present, and future phenomena indicates a coherent and harmonious system rather than a fragmented and chaotic one.\\n- The argument is made that the existence of only one God is necessary to maintain the unity, coherence, and order observed in the universe.\\n\\n## Summary of Main Points:\\n- The belief in multiple gods creating the universe leads to contradictions and complexities that are not observed in reality.\\n- The unity and order in the universe, as evidenced by the interdependence of phenomena and the continuity of cause and effect relationships, support the existence of only one God as the source of creation.\\n\\n# References:\\n## Context Id: epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9\\nBy explaining the contradiction in this belief, it is possible to nullify the argument of those who held such a view.\\nIn order to establish the oneness of God, the Supreme, many arguments have been demonstrated in the different books of theology and philosophy. Here we are going to demonstrate an argument, which encompasses the oneness of lordship and rejects the polytheistic beliefs.\\nThe assumption that the universe has two or more gods can solely be imagined through a few possibilities:\\nFirstly, it can be considered that every phenomenon of the universe is created and is an effect of all the assumed gods. The second assumption could be that each particular group of phenomena is an effect (or created by a particular god) of one of the assumed gods. Finally, the third assumption is that all of the phenomena are created by one of these assumed gods and the other gods are recognized as the managers of the universe.\\nHowever, it is impossible to assume that every phenomenon has several gods. If two or more gods created an existent, it would imply that each of the assumed gods would create an existent. This would result in many existents, whereas in reality there is only one.\\nIf it is to be assumed that a particular god creates each particular phenomenon, this will imply that each phenomenon exists because of its particular god. Furthermore, they must not require or depend upon any other existent unless the (dependency) need returns to their particular god. This type of requirement or need must be upon the existent, which is created by that very creator who has created that particular group.\\nIn other words, the assumption of having more than one god necessitates the order in the universe to be multifarious and deteriorating. In reality there is only one order and all phenomena are related and effectual upon each other and at the same time need each other.\\nFurthermore, the present phenomenon is linked with the former phenomenon and every coexisting phenomenon creates grounds for future phenomena.'}, output_parser=None, template_var_mappings=None, function_mappings=None, message_templates=[ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, content=\"You are an expert Q&A system that strictly operates in two modes when refining existing answers:\\n1. **Rewrite** an original answer using the new context.\\n2. **Repeat** the original answer if the new context isn't useful.\\nNever reference the original answer or context directly in your answer.\\nWhen in doubt, just repeat the original answer.\\nNew Context: {context_msg}\\nQuery: {query_str}\\nOriginal Answer: {existing_answer}\\nNew Answer: \", additional_kwargs={})]))]\n",

      "\n",
      "### 1. Explanation of the Oneness of God:\n",
      "- The context emphasizes the oneness of God as a fundamental belief.\n",
      "- Monotheism entails believing in the unity of God and negating plurality and multiplicity.\n",
      "- Monotheism rejects the existence of two or more independent gods.\n",
      "- The essence of God is considered self-evident and not composed of parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Critique of Polytheistic Beliefs:\n",
      "- Polytheistic beliefs involve attributing lordship to entities other than God.\n",
      "- Polytheists may acknowledge the Creator but assign independent administrators to the world.\n",
      "- The foundation of polytheism lies in recognizing other gods alongside the Supreme Creator.\n",
      "- The Noble Qur’an highlights struggles between monotheistic prophets and polytheists.\n",

      "- It is impossible for every phenomenon to have several gods creating it.\n",
      "- If each phenomenon had a specific god, it would lead to a multitude of creators, contradicting the unity of existence.\n",
      "- The order in the universe is interconnected and coherent, indicating a single creator.\n",

Here we\\nare going to demonstrate an argument, which encompasses the oneness of\\nlordship and rejects the polytheistic beliefs.\\n\\n## Proofs For The Oneness Of God\\n\\nThe assumption that the universe has two or more gods can solely be imagined\\nthrough a few possibilities:\\n\\nFirstly, it can be considered that every phenomenon of the universe is created\\nand is an effect of all the assumed gods. The second assumption could be that\\neach particular group of phenomena is an effect (or created by a particular\\ngod) of one of the assumed gods. Finally, the third assumption is that all of\\nthe phenomena are created by one of these assumed gods and the other gods are\\nrecognized as the managers of the universe.\\n\\nHowever, it is impossible to assume that every phenomenon has several gods. If\\ntwo or more gods created an existent, it would imply that each of the assumed\\ngods would create an existent. This would result in many existents, whereas in\\nreality there is only one.\\n\\nIf it is to be assumed that a particular god creates each particular\\nphenomenon, this will imply that each phenomenon exists because of its\\nparticular god. Furthermore, they must not require or depend upon any other\\nexistent unless the (dependency) need returns to their particular god. This\\ntype of requirement or need must be upon the existent, which is created by\\nthat very creator who has created that particular group.\\n\\nIn other words, the assumption of having more than one god necessitates the\\norder in the universe to be multifarious and deteriorating. In reality there\\nis only one order and all phenomena are related and effectual upon each other\\nand at the same time need each other.\\n\\nFurthermore, the present phenomenon is linked with the former phenomenon and\\nevery coexisting phenomenon creates grounds for future phenomena.\\nid: epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9\\ntitle: Theological Instructions (Amuzish-e Aqa'id)\\nauthor: Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi\\nlanguage: en\\ndescription: \\ntype: epub\\nembeddings: openaiembeddings\\n\\nFurthermore, they considered a type of lordship for themselves and also\\nregarded satanic worship as part of their rituals. Such examples can be seen\\nin the past empires of China, India, Iran and Egypt.\\n\\nNevertheless polytheistic religions came under the influence of different\\nfactors and discernment among humans. Thus, a barrier was formed preventing\\npeople from understanding the true perfection, which was supposed to be\\napplied by the divine and monotheistic religions. The Noble Qur’an portrays\\nsuch struggles encountered by the prophets (‘a) of God and the polytheists.\\n\\nOn these bases, the foundation of polytheistic belief is to believe in the\\nlordship of an existent other than God the Supreme, for the appearance of some\\nof the universe’s phenomena. Furthermore, many polytheists had faith in the\\noneness of the Creator, and in reality they accepted the oneness of\\ncreatorship. However, on a lower realm they recognized other second level\\n\\ngods who administrated the world independently, and they called God the\\nCreator, the God of gods or Lord of the lords _(rabb al-arbab)_.\\n\\nThese gods, who administrate according to some, were known as angels, and were\\ncalled by the polytheist Arabs, the daughters of God. Some recognized them as\\nfairies and genies or some regarded them as the spirits of stars or humans\\nfrom the past, or as a type of invisible existent.\\n\\nIn lesson ten indications were made that creatorship and true lordship are\\ninseparable from each other, belief in the creatorship of God and the\\nacceptance of the lordship of others is not compatible. By explaining the\\ncontradiction in this belief, it is possible to nullify the argument of those\\nwho held such a view.\\n\\nIn order to establish the oneness of God, the Supreme, many arguments have\\nbeen demonstrated in the different books of theology and philosophy. Here we\\nare going to demonstrate an argument, which encompasses the oneness of\\nlordship and rejects the polytheistic beliefs.\\nid: epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9\\ntitle: Theological Instructions (Amuzish-e Aqa'id)\\nauthor: Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi\\nlanguage: en\\ndescription: \\ntype: epub\\nembeddings: openaiembeddings\\n\\nThere is no power except by Allah!” (Holy\\nQur’an,[18:39](/printepub/book/export/html/123734#quran_ref_189052)).** _\\n\\n### D. The Two Important Results Achieved\\n\\nThe result of the unity of Divine action is that nothing other than God\\ndeserves worship, because as we have indicated before, a being does not\\ndeserve to be worshipped by just being a creator or a lord. In other words,\\nDivinity _(uluhiyyah)_ is the necessary condition of lordship and creatorship.\\n\\nFrom another angle, the result of monotheism in the latter meaning is that the\\nentirety of human reliance must be upon God, and in all of works He must be\\ntrusted and solely from Him help must be requested. Man’s fear and hope ought\\nto be from Him, and when the sources for the completion of needs are out of\\nreach, one must not despair, because God is capable of furnishing all needs\\nfrom His distinctive and hidden source.\\n\\nLiving under such monotheistic circumstances results in mankind enjoying a\\nspecial Divine authority _(wilayah)_ and having a unique and tranquil soul:\\n\\n_**“Look! The friends of Allah will indeed have no fear nor will they grieve”\\n(Holy Qur’an,[10:62](/printepub/book/export/html/123734#quran_ref_189053)). **\\n_\\n\\nThese two results have already been placed in the verse that a Muslim recites\\nat-least ten times a day:\\n\\n_**“You [alone] do we worship, and You [alone] do we turn for help” (Holy\\nQur’an,[1:6](/printepub/book/export/html/123734#quran_ref_189056)).** _\\n\\n### E. The Resolution Of A Doubt\\n\\nIt is possible that one may question, that if the necessity of perfect\\nmonotheism is that humans seek help exclusively from God, they should not then\\nseek intercession from the saints of God.\\nid: epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9\\ntitle: Theological Instructions (Amuzish-e Aqa'id)\\nauthor: Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi\\nlanguage: en\\ndescription: \\ntype: epub\\nembeddings: openaiembeddings\\n\\n5- Why can one not regard every group of creation to be created by its\\nparticular god?\\n\\n6- How would you criticise the assumption that the entire universe is created\\nby one God, and at the same time claim that there are many lords and\\nexecuters?\\n\\n7- From where does the illusion of several gods come from, and how can it be\\nnullified?\\n\\n8- Why does it make no difference to the oneness of lordship and creatorship,\\nif one believes in the Divine authority for the saints?\\n\\n# Lesson 17: The Meaning Of The Oneness Of The God\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe word monotheism from the lexical point of view means ‘oneness or unity’,\\nbut in philosophy, scholastic theology, ethics _(akhlaq),_ and mysticism it\\nhas been applied with various different meanings. However it gives the same\\nbasic meaning in all of these sciences, but when viewed from different aspects\\nit can be regarded differently, such as ‘the different forms of oneness’ or\\n‘the different levels of oneness’. The investigation of these offshoots cannot\\nbe comprised in these writings.\\n\\nTherefore, from this angle it is sufficient enough that we bring the most\\nsignificant and befitting arguments for our explanation:\\n\\n## The Negation Of Plurality\\n\\nThe initial and distinguished meaning of monotheism is that very believing in\\nthe unity of God and negation of plurality and multiplicity outside its\\nessence. This belief is in complete opposition to polytheism, and the belief\\nin two or more gods who are independent and apart in their existence from each\\nother.\\n\\n## The Negation Of Composition\\n\\nhe second terminological meaning of monotheism is to believe in oneness, and\\nto believe that the essence is self-evident and not composed of actual or\\npotential parts.\\n\\nThis meaning is usually interpreted as the negative attributes _(al-sifat al-\\nsalbiyyah)_ (mentioned in lesson ten), because our mind is more familiar with\\ncompositional concepts as compared to the concept of self-evidence.\\nid: epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9\\ntitle: Theological Instructions (Amuzish-e Aqa'id)\\nauthor: Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi\\nlanguage: en\\ndescription: \\ntype: epub\\nembeddings: openaiembeddings\\n\\nHowever, it can never be accepted that several causes can bestow\\nexistence for an effect, or that several lords and independent administrators\\ncan be assumed for administrating the universe.\\n\\nBased on this argument for nullifying this illusion, one must focus upon the\\nmeaning and the peculiarities of this cause that bestows existence until it is\\nknown that the profusion of this cause is impossible. Furthermore, one must\\ncontemplate upon the coherence of the creation until reaching the realization\\nthat several gods could not possibly create this type of order, or numerous\\nlords administer this type of universe.\\n\\nLikewise it became clear for some of the qualified and saintly individuals of\\nGod, that by accepting Divine authority _(wilayah al-takwiniyyah)_ in a\\nsetting where there is no independent lordship or creatorship over them, the\\noneness of God would not be negated. The legislative authority _(wilayah al-\\ntashri’iyyah)_ of the Prophet (S) and Imams (‘a) is not inconsistent with the\\nDivine legislative lordship _(rububiyyah al- tashri’iyyah)_ , because it comes\\nwith the Divine degree.\\n\\n## Questions\\n\\n1- Explain the causes for the development of polytheism.\\n\\n2- What is the basis of polytheism?\\n\\n3- Why can one not assume that a phenomenon has several gods?\\n\\n4- What difference is caused if one considers that the creation created by one\\ngod has several lords to administer it?\\n\\n5- Why can one not regard every group of creation to be created by its\\nparticular god?\\n\\n6- How would you criticise the assumption that the entire universe is created\\nby one God, and at the same time claim that there are many lords and\\nexecuters?\\n\\n7- From where does the illusion of several gods come from, and how can it be\\nnullified?\\n\\n8- Why does it make no difference to the oneness of lordship and creatorship,\\nif one believes in the Divine authority for the saints?\"]...'\n",

      "   - Monotheism refers to the belief in the existence of only one God.\n",
      "   - It involves the negation of plurality and multiplicity in the essence of God.\n",
      "   - Monotheism opposes polytheism, which believes in multiple independent gods.\n",

The Two Important Results Achieved\\n\\nThe result of the unity of Divine action is that nothing other than God\\ndeserves worship, because as we have indicated before, a being does not\\ndeserve to be worshipped by just being a creator or a lord. In other words,\\nDivinity _(uluhiyyah)_ is the necessary condition of lordship and creatorship.\\n\\nFrom another angle, the result of monotheism in the latter meaning is that the\\nentirety of human reliance must be upon God, and in all of works He must be\\ntrusted and solely from Him help must be requested.

However it gives the same\\nbasic meaning in all of these sciences, but when viewed from different aspects\\nit can be regarded differently, such as ‘the different forms of oneness’ or\\n‘the different levels of oneness’. The investigation of these offshoots cannot\\nbe comprised in these writings.\\n\\nTherefore, from this angle it is sufficient enough that we bring the most\\nsignificant and befitting arguments for our explanation:\\n\\n## The Negation Of Plurality\\n\\nThe initial and distinguished meaning of monotheism is that very believing in\\nthe unity of God and negation of plurality and multiplicity outside its\\nessence. This belief is in complete opposition to polytheism, and the belief\\nin two or more gods who are independent and apart in their existence from each\\nother.\\n\\n## The Negation Of Composition\\n\\nhe second terminological meaning of monotheism is to believe in oneness, and\\nto believe that the essence is self-evident and not composed of actual or\\npotential parts.\\n\\nThis meaning is usually interpreted as the negative attributes _(al-sifat al-\\nsalbiyyah)_ (mentioned in lesson ten), because our mind is more familiar with\\ncompositional concepts as compared to the concept of self-evidence.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=167801, end_char_idx=169737, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.048958333333333326), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='632a27d7-4721-4229-b881-762e353d3960', embedding=None, metadata={'id': 'epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9', 'title': \"Theological Instructions (Amuzish-e Aqa'id)\", 'author': 'Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi', 'language': 'en', 'description': '', 'type': 'epub', 'embeddings': 'openaiembeddings'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a68c1e50-47bc-467a-9589-0a84bf4d0357', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'id': 'epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9', 'title': \"Theological Instructions (Amuzish-e Aqa'id)\", 'author': 'Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi', 'language': 'en', 'description': '', 'type': 'epub', 'embeddings': 'openaiembeddings'}, hash='c31b0860b0e4f814a78c7debf6367c2afd50d977ac6278f307767efcf5e6807b'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='df882b25-3f64-4888-bf36-6521b524e627', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'id': 'epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9', 'title': \"Theological Instructions (Amuzish-e Aqa'id)\", 'author': 'Muhammad Taqi Misbah Yazdi', 'language': 'en', 'description': '', 'type': 'epub', 'embeddings': 'openaiembeddings'}, hash='f36ba9f201c3b0216dfe1de2899ccdf570c73926b1431bd64799afa3b057804b'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='9fd3899c-0608-43d2-8768-39bbdb0e5d42', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='60ff9eef2ed1c819dc1a58280e30685a55864a29425d5f3b140df8ccb4153dd2')}, text='Furthermore, they considered a type of lordship for themselves and also\\nregarded satanic worship as part of their rituals.

      "# Lesson 17: The Meaning Of The Oneness Of The God\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The word monotheism from the lexical point of view means ‘oneness or unity’,\n",
      "but in philosophy, scholastic theology, ethics _(akhlaq),_ and mysticism it\n",
      "has been applied with various different meanings. However it gives the same\n",
      "basic meaning in all of these sciences, but when viewed from different aspects\n",
      "it can be regarded differently, such as ‘the different forms of oneness’ or\n",
      "‘the different levels of oneness’. The investigation of these offshoots cannot\n",
      "be comprised in these writings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, from this angle it is sufficient enough that we bring the most\n",
      "significant and befitting arguments for our explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Negation Of Plurality\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial and distinguished meaning of monotheism is that very believing in\n",
      "the unity of God and negation of plurality and multiplicity outside its\n",
      "essence. This belief is in complete opposition to polytheism, and the belief\n",
      "in two or more gods who are independent and apart in their existence from each\n",
      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Negation Of Composition\n",
      "\n",
      "he second terminological meaning of monotheism is to believe in oneness, and\n",
      "to believe that the essence is self-evident and not composed of actual or\n",
      "potential parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "This meaning is usually interpreted as the negative attributes _(al-sifat al-\n",
      "salbiyyah)_ (mentioned in lesson ten), because our mind is more familiar with\n",
      "compositional concepts as compared to the concept of self-evidence.\n",

      "regarded satanic worship as part of their rituals. Such examples can be seen\n",
      "in the past empires of China, India, Iran and Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless polytheistic religions came under the influence of different\n",
      "factors and discernment among humans. Thus, a barrier was formed preventing\n",
      "people from understanding the true perfection, which was supposed to be\n",
      "applied by the divine and monotheistic religions. The Noble Qur’an portrays\n",
      "such struggles encountered by the prophets (‘a) of God and the polytheists.\n",
      "\n",
      "On these bases, the foundation of polytheistic belief is to believe in the\n",
      "lordship of an existent other than God the Supreme, for the appearance of some\n",
      "of the universe’s phenomena. Furthermore, many polytheists had faith in the\n",
      "oneness of the Creator, and in reality they accepted the oneness of\n",
      "creatorship. However, on a lower realm they recognized other second level\n",
      "\n",
      "gods who administrated the world independently, and they called God the\n",
      "Creator, the God of gods or Lord of the lords _(rabb al-arbab)_.\n",
      "\n",
      "These gods, who administrate according to some, were known as angels, and were\n",
      "called by the polytheist Arabs, the daughters of God. Some recognized them as\n",
      "fairies and genies or some regarded them as the spirits of stars or humans\n",
      "from the past, or as a type of invisible existent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In lesson ten indications were made that creatorship and true lordship are\n",
      "inseparable from each other, belief in the creatorship of God and the\n",
      "acceptance of the lordship of others is not compatible. By explaining the\n",
      "contradiction in this belief, it is possible to nullify the argument of those\n",
      "who held such a view.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to establish the oneness of God, the Supreme, many arguments have\n",
      "been demonstrated in the different books of theology and philosophy. Here we\n",

      "\n",
      "## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. The Negation of Plurality:\n",
      "- The initial meaning of monotheism is believing in the unity of God and negating plurality and multiplicity outside His essence.\n",
      "- This belief opposes polytheism, which involves belief in multiple independent gods.\n",
      "- Monotheism asserts that there is only one God, and all other entities are not divine beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The Negation of Composition:\n",
      "- Another aspect of monotheism is the belief in the oneness of God's essence, which is self-evident and not composed of parts.\n",
      "- This concept rejects the idea of God being made up of actual or potential parts.\n",
      "- Monotheism emphasizes the simplicity and indivisibility of God's essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Unity of Lordship and Creatorship:\n",
      "- Belief in the oneness of God also entails the unity of lordship and creatorship.\n",
      "- Even if one believes in the Divine authority of saints or intermediaries, it does not affect the oneness of God's lordship and creatorship.\n",
      "- The concept of Tawhid (oneness of God) encompasses the idea that all acts of creation and governance ultimately stem from one source, which is God.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "- The belief in one God is rooted in the negation of plurality and composition, emphasizing the unity of God's essence and attributes.\n",
      "- Monotheism asserts that there is only one divine being who is not composed of parts and is the ultimate source of all creation and governance.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Key Components of the Question:\n",
      "1. Why is there only one God?\n",
      "2. How does seeking help exclusively from God relate to the concept of monotheism and intercession from saints?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why is there only one God?\n",
      "1. **Unity of Divine Action**: \n",
      "   - The unity of Divine action implies that nothing other than God deserves worship.\n",
      "   - Divinity is the necessary condition of lordship and creatorship.\n",
      "   - This unity leads to the conclusion that only God deserves worship, as He is the ultimate source of all creation and sustenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Human Reliance on God**:\n",
      "   - Monotheism requires that human reliance must be solely upon God.\n",
      "   - All works should be trusted to God, and help should be sought only from Him.\n",
      "   - Fear, hope, and completion of needs should all be directed towards God.\n",
      "   - Despair should not arise as God is capable of fulfilling all needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Special Divine Authority and Tranquil Soul**:\n",
      "   - Living under monotheistic circumstances grants mankind a special Divine authority and a tranquil soul.\n",
      "   - The friends of Allah will have no fear or grief, indicating a state of peace and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Seeking Help Exclusively from God vs. Intercession from Saints:\n",
      "1. **Contradiction with Monotheism**:\n",
      "   - Seeking intercession from saints contradicts the concept of monotheism.\n",
      "   - Monotheism requires exclusive reliance on God for help and guidance.\n",
      "   - Seeking intercession from saints implies attributing divine powers to entities other than God, which goes against the fundamental principle of monotheism.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verse Recitation**:\n",
      "   - The verse recited by Muslims emphasizes worship and seeking help from God alone.\n",
      "   - This reinforces the idea that all reliance and assistance should come from God, without involving intermediaries like saints.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary:\n",
      "- The concept of monotheism dictates that there is only one God who deserves worship and reliance.\n",
      "- Seeking help exclusively from God is a fundamental aspect of monotheism, as He is the ultimate source of all needs.\n",
      "- Intercession from saints contradicts monotheism by diverting reliance from God to intermediaries.\n",
      "- The unity of Divine action and the special authority granted by monotheism highlight the importance of direct connection with God for believers.\n",

      "  - Each phenomenon created by a specific god.\n",
      "  - One god creating all phenomena with others managing the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Impossibility of Multiple Gods:\n",
      "- If multiple gods created existents, it would lead to many existents, contradicting the reality of one.\n",
      "- If each phenomenon had a specific god, it would imply a complex and deteriorating order in the universe, contrary to the observed unity and interdependence of phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Unity and Interdependence:\n",
      "- The text emphasizes that the universe operates under one order where all phenomena are interconnected and mutually dependent.\n",
      "- Each phenomenon is linked to past and future phenomena, creating a coherent and continuous chain of existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Conclusion:\n",
      "- The argument presented in the text demonstrates that the existence of multiple gods is logically untenable due to the unity, coherence, and interdependence observed in the universe.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Summary:\n",
      "- The text provides a logical argument against the existence of multiple gods based on the unity, coherence, and interdependence of phenomena in the universe.\n",
      "- The interconnected nature of all phenomena and the continuous chain of existence support the belief in one God as the creator and sustainer of the universe.\n",

      "Proofs For The Oneness Of God\n",
      "The assumption that the universe has two or more gods can solely be imagined through a few possibilities:\n",
      "Firstly, it can be considered that every phenomenon of the universe is created and is an effect of all the assumed gods. The second assumption could be that each particular group of phenomena is an effect (or created by a particular god) of one of the assumed gods. Finally, the third assumption is that all of the phenomena are created by one of these assumed gods and the other gods are recognized as the managers of the universe.\n",
      "However, it is impossible to assume that every phenomenon has several gods. If two or more gods created an existent, it would imply that each of the assumed gods would create an existent. This would result in many existents, whereas in reality there is only one.\n",
      "If it is to be assumed that a particular god creates each particular phenomenon, this will imply that each phenomenon exists because of its particular god. Furthermore, they must not require or depend upon any other existent unless the (dependency) need returns to their particular god. This type of requirement or need must be upon the existent, which is created by that very creator who has created that particular group.\n",
      "In other words, the assumption of having more than one god necessitates the order in the universe to be multifarious and deteriorating. In reality there is only one order and all phenomena are related and effectual upon each other and at the same time need each other.\n",
      "Furthermore, the present phenomenon is linked with the former phenomenon and every coexisting phenomenon creates grounds for future phenomena.\n",

      "## Key Components of the Question:\n",
      "1. Understanding the concept of monotheism and polytheism.\n",
      "2. Exploring the reasons for the belief in one God.\n",
      "3. Analyzing the arguments against polytheistic beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Understanding Monotheism and Polytheism:\n",
      "- **Monotheism**: Belief in the existence of only one God.\n",
      "- **Polytheism**: Belief in the existence of multiple gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Reasons for the Belief in One God:\n",
      "- The context mentions that the foundation of polytheistic belief is to believe in the lordship of an existent other than God for the appearance of some phenomena.\n",
      "- Polytheists recognized other gods who administrated the world independently but accepted the oneness of creatorship.\n",
      "- The argument is made that creatorship and true lordship are inseparable, and belief in the creatorship of God and the acceptance of the lordship of others are incompatible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Arguments Against Polytheistic Beliefs:\n",
      "- The text indicates that to establish the oneness of God, many arguments have been demonstrated in different theological and philosophical books.\n",
      "- An argument is presented that encompasses the oneness of lordship and rejects polytheistic beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion:\n",
      "- The belief in one God is supported by the inseparability of creatorship and true lordship, as explained in the context.\n",
      "- Polytheistic beliefs are refuted based on the argument that accepting the lordship of other gods contradicts the oneness of God's lordship and creatorship.\n",

      "Furthermore, they considered a type of lordship for themselves and also regarded satanic worship as part of their rituals. Such examples can be seen in the past empires of China, India, Iran, and Egypt.\n",
      "Nevertheless polytheistic religions came under the influence of different factors and discernment among humans. Thus, a barrier was formed preventing people from understanding the true perfection, which was supposed to be applied by the divine and monotheistic religions. The Noble Qur’an portrays such struggles encountered by the prophets (‘a) of God and the polytheists.\n",
      "On these bases, the foundation of polytheistic belief is to believe in the lordship of an existent other than God the Supreme, for the appearance of some of the universe’s phenomena. Furthermore, many polytheists had faith in the oneness of the Creator, and in reality, they accepted the oneness of creatorship. However, on a lower realm they recognized other second level gods who administrated the world independently, and they called God the Creator, the God of gods or Lord of the lords (rabb al-arbab).\n",
      "These gods, who administrate according to some, were known as angels, and were called by the polytheist Arabs, the daughters of God. Some recognized them as fairies and genies or some regarded them as the spirits of stars or humans from the past, or as a type of invisible existent.\n",
      "In lesson ten indications were made that creatorship and true lordship are inseparable from each other, belief in the creatorship of God and the acceptance of the lordship of others is not compatible. By explaining the contradiction in this belief, it is possible to nullify the argument of those who held such a view.\n",
      "In order to establish the oneness of God, the Supreme, many arguments have been demonstrated in the different books of theology and philosophy. Here we are going to demonstrate an argument, which encompasses the oneness of lordship and rejects the polytheistic beliefs.\n",

      "Response 5: # Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Components:\n",
      "1. Understanding the concept of monotheism.\n",
      "2. Explaining why there is only one God based on the provided context.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Understanding Monotheism:\n",
      "- Monotheism is the belief in the existence of only one God.\n",
      "- The context emphasizes the oneness of God and refutes the idea of multiple gods or lords.\n",
      "- It mentions that the profusion of causes for existence or administrators for the universe is impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Why There is Only One God:\n",
      "- **Unity of Cause**: The text argues that the profusion of causes for existence is impossible. This implies that there can only be one ultimate cause, which is God.\n",
      "- **Coherence of Creation**: Contemplating the coherence of creation leads to the realization that several gods could not create such order or administer the universe.\n",
      "- **Divine Authority**: Accepting Divine authority does not negate the oneness of God. The legislative authority of the Prophet and Imams is not inconsistent with Divine lordship.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Critique of Polytheistic Beliefs:\n",
      "- **Polytheism Development**: Polytheism arises from the illusion of several gods being responsible for different aspects of creation.\n",
      "- **Basis of Polytheism**: Polytheism is based on the assumption that multiple gods can bestow existence or administer the universe.\n",
      "- **Invalidity of Multiple Gods**: It is not feasible to assume that a phenomenon has several gods because the coherence and order of creation point to a single ultimate cause.\n",
      "- **Creation by One God with Multiple Lords**: If creation by one god had multiple lords to administer it, it would disrupt the coherence and order of the universe.\n",
      "- **Particular Gods for Creation**: Not every group of creation can be attributed to a particular god as it would lead to fragmentation and lack of unity in creation.\n",
      "- **Criticism of Multiple Lords**: Claiming that the universe is created by one God while having many lords and executors contradicts the unity and coherence of creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Nullifying the Illusion of Multiple Gods:\n",
      "- **Origin of Illusion**: The illusion of several gods arises from a misunderstanding of the causes for existence and administration of the universe.\n",
      "- **Nullification**: By focusing on the meaning and peculiarities of the ultimate cause (God) and contemplating the coherence of creation, the illusion of multiple gods can be nullified.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary:\n",
      "- The concept of monotheism is central to the provided context, emphasizing the oneness of God and refuting the idea of multiple gods or lords.\n",
      "- The argument against polytheism is based on the unity of cause, coherence of creation, and acceptance of Divine authority, which all point towards the existence of only one God.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Context Id: epub-24542662e8fa47f2b48246bcd9c6c2e9\n",
      "However, it can never be accepted that several causes can bestow existence for an effect, or that several lords and independent administrators can be assumed for administrating the universe.\n",
      "Based on this argument for nullifying this illusion, one must focus upon the meaning and the peculiarities of this cause that bestows existence until it is known that the profusion of this cause is impossible. Furthermore, one must contemplate upon the coherence of the creation until reaching the realization that several gods could not possibly create this type of order, or numerous lords administer this type of universe.\n",
      "Likewise it became clear for some of the qualified and saintly individuals of God, that by accepting Divine authority (wilayah al-takwiniyyah) in a setting where there is no independent lordship or creatorship over them, the oneness of God would not be negated. The legislative authority (wilayah al-tashri’iyyah) of the Prophet (S) and Imams (‘a) is not inconsistent with the Divine legislative lordship (rububiyyah al- tashri’iyyah) , because it comes with the Divine degree.\n"

      "\n",
